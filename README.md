# Jakub's Max/MSP Abstractions and Externals

Here's a collection of mostly tiny, usually badly documented, yet often incredibly
useful abstractions/externals (what exactly is the difference??) for Max/MSP that
I've been building throughout the years to help me save time.

Just a few highlights as I can't be bothered to doc all of them:

+ [stoggle] and [sbang] are a toggle and a bang, controlled by the spacebar
+ [patcher_path] gives you the absolute system path to your current patch file, and appends a string at the end
+ [forminterp] is basically a simultaneous [line] ramp over a list of values
+ [duration] counts seconds until the specified number
+ [badsr] is a badass scrubbable ADSR based on a specified [buffer~]
+ [intStringGenerator] doesn't work, sorry
+ [jit.beware] is a generic warning message generator for loud, flashy, horrible performance art. Needs more flexibility though.
+ lots more to come â€¦
